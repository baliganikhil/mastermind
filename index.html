                    I played an interesting board game called Mastermind and decided to make a software version of it. It's a puzzle involving logic.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    There are 6 colours and 4 slots. When the game begins, the computer generates a puzzle where each slot has a corresponding colour. The objective of the game is to guess the colours and the correct slot to which the colours belong to. Colours may repeat in a problem.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    To start playing, drag and drop the colours from the left into the slots at the top. Once you have filled the 4 slots, submit your move. The computer then checks and tells you how many of the colours are in the right slot, and how many of the remaining colours are correct but in an incorrect slot. Using this, you will have to make your next move till you get all four colours and slots right
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <h5>Example</h5>
                    Assume that the puzzle generated by the computer is:
                    <br>"Red", "Blue", "Yellow", "Pink"
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    You may start off by randomly filling the slots. Perhaps you chose: <br>
                    "Pink", "Blue", "Red", "Green" <br>
                    and submit the move
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    The computer evaluates this and says that 1 colour is in the right slot (In this case, it is blue) and 2 colours are in incorrect slots (In this case, Red and Pink). You then proceed to discard one of the colours (at random, since we don't know which colour is wrong) and rearrange the pieces and evaluate again. Remember, it's a puzzle
