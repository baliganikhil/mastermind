Mastermind is a logic puzzle game

There are 6 colours and 4 slots. When the game begins, the computer generates a puzzle where each slot has a corresponding colour. The objective of the game is to guess the colours and the correct slot to which the colours belong to.

To start playing, drag and drop the colours from the left into the slots at the top. Once you have filled the 4 slots, submit your move. The computer then checks and tells you how many of the colours are in the right slot, and how many of the remaining colours are correct but in an incorrect slot. Using this, you will have to make your next move till you get all four colours and slots right

It's a lot harder than it appears!
